Welcome to the interactive SQL Views tutorial! üöÄ

A **view** is a virtual table that provides a way to simplify complex queries, improve data security, and organize data presentation.

### What We'll Cover:
1. Creating Views
2. Updating Views
3. Materialized Views
4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Views
5. Dropping Views

    st.markdown("""
    **Definition**: A view is a saved query that acts as a virtual table. It doesn't store data but retrieves it dynamically from underlying tables.

    **SQL Syntax**:
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```

    **Example**: Create a view to display employees from the Engineering department.

    CREATE VIEW engineering_employees AS
    SELECT emp_id, name, salary
    FROM employees

# Updating Views
with tabs[1]:
    st.header("‚úèÔ∏è Updating Views")
    st.markdown("""
    **Can Views Be Updated?**
    - Yes, if they are simple and based on a single table without aggregate functions.
    - No, if they involve joins, groupings, or computed columns.

    **SQL Syntax**:
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```

    **Example**: Update the `engineering_employees` view to include employee IDs greater than 1.

# Materialized Views
with tabs[2]:
    st.header("üìÇ Materialized Views")
    st.markdown("""
    **Definition**: A materialized view stores the result of a query as a physical table, unlike a regular view, which is virtual.

    **SQL Syntax**:
    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```

    **Example**: Create a materialized view for employees with a salary greater than 60,000.

    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW high_salary_employees AS

# Advantages & Disadvantages
with tabs[3]:
    st.header("‚öñÔ∏è Advantages & Disadvantages")
    st.markdown("""
    **Advantages of Views**:
    1. Simplifies complex queries by abstracting them.
    2. Enhances security by restricting direct access to underlying tables.
    3. Provides consistent and reusable query results.

    **Disadvantages of Views**:
    1. Can slow performance for large datasets (since views are dynamically computed).
    2. Limited support for updating views with complex logic.
    3. Materialized views require extra storage and maintenance.

    **Interactive Comparison**:
    - Views are better for dynamic data presentation.
    - Materialized views are better for performance-critical queries.

# Dropping Views
with tabs[4]:
    st.header("‚ùå Dropping Views")
    st.markdown("""
    If a view is no longer needed, you can drop it using the `DROP VIEW` statement.

    **SQL Syntax**:
    ```sql
    DROP VIEW view_name;
    ```

    **Example**: Drop the `engineering_employees` view.
